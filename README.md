# Traffic-Dodger
A game where you most dodge between lanes of oncoming traffic and try to go as far as possible without crashing. This game has nicely put together graphics, menus and a car customization seciton, as well as a live running high score, that saves when the game is closed, and is reuploaded when opened again, so you can always save your progress

The source code is in the 'culminating_racing_game.pde' file, the rest are images for graphics and the high score text file
